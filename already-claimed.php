    <p><strong>Sorry!</strong> It looks like you <strong>already claimed</strong> a reward.</p>
    
    <p>Please be aware that we want to distribute as <strong>many MSC</strong> as possible.</p>
    
    <p>It would be <strong>unfair</strong>, if one user claims multiple rewards.</p>

    <p>Therefore we limit the amount of rewards per person to <strong>one</strong>.</p>
    
    <p>If you are certain that you never claimed a reward, please contact us via

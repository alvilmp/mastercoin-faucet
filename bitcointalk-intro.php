    <p>Great, you chose authentication via <strong>bitcointalk.org</strong>. You can earn <strong>$0.5 worth of Mastercoin</strong> with this method, but you need an
    <strong>activity score above 10</strong> as well as <strong>at least 10 posts</strong> and furthermore your account must be <strong>created before August 1, 
    2013</strong>.</p>
    
    <p>Those requirements are a protection against abuse, so we are able to give out <strong>free MCS</strong> to as many interested people as possible.</p>
        
    <p>Here comes the tricky part, you need to do three things to claim the reward. At first, you have to find a link to your <strong>user profile</strong>. 
    This is easy, just go to one of your posts and right click on your username. You can then choose <strong>copy link address</strong>. Paste the link to your profile
    in the first box below.</p>
    
    <p>Then you have to make sure that you entered a <strong>Bitcoin address</strong> in your profile. You need to sign a message with that address soon, so make sure
    you are the owner of this address. You can set an address under <strong>Profile - Forum Profile Information</strong>.</p>
    
    <p>At last sign the message <strong>Mastercoin faucet</strong> with the address in your profile and copy the signature into the second box below
    and click <strong>submit</strong>.</p>

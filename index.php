  <h3>What is Mastercoin?</h3>
  <span class="description">
    <p>Mastercoin is an open source project driven by the members of the Bitcoin community that want to see more
    advanced features implemented on top of the blockchain.</p>
    <p>Mastercoin enables the Bitcoin eco-system to become more decentralized and operate more in line with its 
    peer to peer nature. History has shown that when a digital service has a single point of failure it will be 
    attacked and taken down. Mastercoin removes many of today's bottle necks, that are preventing the wide spread 
    use of Bitcoin.</p>

  <h3>How can I earn MSC?</h3>
  <span class="description">
    <p>This website, the Mastercoin faucet, rewards users with small amounts of Mastercoin and is sponsored by 
    <a href="http://www.mastercoin.org" target="_blank"><strong>the Mastercoin Foundation</strong></a> to allow users 
    to get more familiar with this additional protocol layer and to spread awareness. <strong>We are currently in a test 
    phase to gather feedback and eliminate potential bugs before switching to more significant amounts. If you like, 
    visit the <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=321358.0" target="_blank">developer thread</a> on 
    bitcointalk.org. Feel free to test crazy stuff! :p</strong></p>
    <p>To unlock a reward, choose one of the following authentication methods. The authentication steps and requirements are 
    intended to prevent abuse, because our goal is to reach as many interested people as possible. Only one reward per person.</p>

  <h3>What is Mastercoin?</h3>
  <span class="description">
    <p>Mastercoin is an <strong>open source</strong> project driven by the members of the <strong>Bitcoin community</strong> that want to see more
    advanced features implemented on top of the <strong>blockchain</strong>.</p>
    <p><strong>Mastercoin</strong> enables the Bitcoin eco-system to become <strong>more decentralized</strong> and operate more in line with its 
    <strong>peer to peer nature</strong>. History has shown that when a <strong>digital service</strong> has a single point of failure it will be 
    attacked and taken down. Mastercoin removes many of today's bottle necks, that are preventing the <strong>wide spread 
    use of Bitcoin</strong>.</p>
